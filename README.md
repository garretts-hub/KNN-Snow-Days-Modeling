# Predicting First Snow Dates of the Season using K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
Here's a fun little application of Scikit-learn K-Nearest Neighbors regression modeling. We'll use NOAA's GHCND dataset (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/), just like in my "Snow-Days" visualization project here.<br><br>
We'll use the Latitude, Longitude, and date of first observed snow (converted to the integer number of days relative to September 1st) for all continental U.S. weather stations from 1980 to 2020. The output is a heatmap of the predicted first date of snow across the entire continent, where the KNN model predicts the date based off the latitude and longitude, and is trained by the prepped GHCND dataset.<br><br>
Some interesting things to play around with the in the future could include using the elevation of the station when training the model or the season year. The latter would allow you to model changes over time, not just over geography.<br><br>
Everything you'll need is self-contained in an IPython notebook and the `data` directory.
